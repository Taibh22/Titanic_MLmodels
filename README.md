# Titanic Machine Learning Models

This project is a machine learning model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck based on various features such as age, sex, and passenger class. The project includes EDA, data wrangling, handling missing values, feature engineering techniques, evaluation matrices, and training on logistic regression, decision trees, and random forest algorithms.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need the following:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Numpy
- Scikit-Learn

You can install the required dependencies using pip by running the following command:


pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy scikit-learn


## Running the Project

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook file `Titanic_MLmodels.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run the cells in the notebook to perform EDA, data wrangling, missing values handling, feature engineering, and training on logistic regression,decision trees, and random forest algorithms.

The notebook contains detailed comments to explain what each section of the code does.

## Results

The final result of the project is three different machine learning models trained on the Titanic dataset: logistic regression, decision trees, and random forest. The models are evaluated using different evaluation metrics such as accuracy score, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC curve.

The results of the evaluation show that the random forest model performed the best with an accuracy score of 0.82. The model also had high precision, recall, and F1-score values, indicating that it is a good model for predicting which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

## Future Work

There are several ways that this project could be extended or improved in the future, such as:

- Trying different feature engineering techniques to improve the performance of the models.
- Using other machine learning algorithms such as support vector machines or neural networks.
- Tuning the hyperparameters of the models to improve their performance.
- Using other evaluation metrics to get a more complete picture of the performance of the models.
